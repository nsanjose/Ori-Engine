Kodde's humus.name pre blurred cube maps pack v1
------------------------------------------------

All of the source material for these cube maps was aquired humus.name who is generous enough to share this with the 3D internet community. For information on rights to  the source material for the cubemaps in this pack read the "__humus_readme.txt".

Feel free to use the cube maps I have generated for whatever purpose you would like. If you use it commercially credit me accordingly. Feel free to credit me even for non-commercial work if you want to, although you are not required to.

In this package you will find ALL environment packs available from humus.name (2012-03-15), the expection is the "Earth" package which I was unable to process for some to me unknown reason.

Each environment has been processed through ATI's CubeMapGen software. They are 1024px at mip 0. "Mip Initial Filter Angle" is set at 3 to blur the mips. This is because these cube maps are intended to be used in conjunction with a shader which utilizes pre blurred mip levels such as my realtime shaders "KoddeShader 2.0" and "TGA PBL shader" for the Autodesk Maya viewport. They are stored as uncompress A8R8G8B8 DDSs.
